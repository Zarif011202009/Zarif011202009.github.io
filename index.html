           <p>Why did I choose to study CSE?
           <br>To answer this, we have to dive deep into my childhood, where I had spent most of my time with computers. My fascination for computers stayed with me up until 
           I passed my HSC exam, when my fascination it turned into a genuine interest and career choice. I have always had interest in solving problems, churning out simple
           solutions for complex problems. Moreover, I have always looked up to people like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and several other influential developers 
           of the world. I aspire to develop programs that one day would hopefully impact people's lives in a positive manner and make the world a better place.</p>
